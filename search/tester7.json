Collect all 7 of the notebooks and escape the school, all while avoiding Baldi.\u00a0Baldi has many friends in the school that will slow down your progress and put you at risk of being caught, so learn how each character works and how you can avoid their attention. Find and use items to your advantage. Oh, and finally, try not to get the quiz answers wrong...\u00a0Each wrong answer makes Baldi angrier...\nControls\nUse\u00a0the WASD keys to move, and the mouse to turn.\u00a0Left click to open doors and pick up items, right click to use the currently selected item, and scroll wheel to change the currently selected item. Hold down shift to run (Keep an\u00a0eye on your stamina bar!), and press space bar to quickly look behind you.\u00a0Escape can be used to pause.\nCheck out the new demo\n\nCheck out what's coming in the full game!\nPre-order the full game through Backerkit\n\nVisit the full game's Backerkit pre-order store!\nLinks\nWebsite\nTwitter\nKickstarter Updates\nYouTube\n\nMerch\n\nBaldi's Basics merch is now available!\nCredits\nGame by\u00a0Micah\u00a0McGonigal\nPlay testers:\nNintendoNautCommanderGwonam\nTools used:\nUnityGIMPAudacityAnim8or\nFAQ\nIs there a mobile version of Baldi's Basics?\nYes there is!

It's currently in development by GB Patch Games. A 44,000 word demo is available for anyone who's interested. It includes scenes from childhood and adolescence.\u00a0\n\n\nA slice-of-life story with comedy, romance, drama, and many wonderful memories to make.\nPrice: Free-to-Play, with optional paid DLCs that add events and Love Interests\nRating: 16+, for swearing, crude humor, and suggestive content during adult-aged portions of the game\nRelease Date: Summer 2020 for Steps 1-3, Fall or Winter 2020 for Step 4\nPlatforms: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, Steam\n4 different periods of life to experience; childhood, adolescence, teen-aged, and adulthoodName, appearance, personality, and pronoun (he, she, or they) customization for your characterThe option to change your character's details however you like as you grow, including transitioning to new pronounsA choice-heavy Visual Novel with frequent opportunities to shape your personality, feelings, and preferences1 main love interest, Cove Holden, whose personality, interests, and\u00a0appearance will develop in a custom way over the years\u00a0based on his\u00a0experiences with youDecide for yourself how quickly or slowly the relationship develops between you and Cove by setting a unique dynamic that can change over time6-8 hours of content that's free for everyone, plus optional paid DLCs that increase playtimeLight animation effects. The sun shines, characters blink, and more (animations can also be turned off)Partial voice acting\u00a0A voiced name feature. Choose one of the options on a 600-name-long list and hear that name said aloud by Cove throughout the story \u2764\n\nThe beta version of Our Life is available for our patrons on Patreon! It includes much more content and receives monthly updates. We're also running a special promotion currently. If you join at the $1 tier or higher you can take part in polls to determine major elements of the next game in the Our Life franchise! It's gonna be a really fun time.\nPlease consider supporting us, if you can. Sharing the game and telling us your thoughts is also very helpful. Thank you for looking! If you give the game a try, we hope you'll enjoy.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nOur Life is built around creating a life that's all your own and developing a unique connection with one specific character, Cove Holden. It begins as a summer vacation of childhood. Once that ends time moves on to another summer but during  young adolescence, then it continues to when everyone is teen-aged, and finally adulthood. The protagonist is highly customizable. You\u2019ll decide their name, appearance, gender, personality, interests, relationships, and what becomes of them in the future. The physical look you've set for the main character is referenced through text during game events. The game's perspective is first person, so the MC's design is only directly shown on screen as a simple approximation during decision making processes.\n\nEach time the character grows into a new stage of life you'll have the option to change their details, including the pronouns they use and first name they go by. \nOur Life is choice-heavy with near constant opportunities to determine what what character thinks/feels. The choices you make in one period of life will have an impact on what happens in the next stage. The regular event choices are centered on developing your protagonist and Cove as people, rather than what they think of each other.\nFor example, if an in-game choice appears with the options of teasing Cove or comforting him, teasing won't lower your closeness and comforting won't increase your closeness. Instead what you pick will have a hand in influencing your personality and the kind of man he grows up to be. There are no bad endings in Our Life and Cove will only refuse to take an interest in you if you choose that specifically. So pick anything that feels right.\r\n  \n\nCove Holden is the main love interest of Our Life and he is also changeable. As a child his features are consistent, but as he begins to grow there are multiple directions his looks, interests, and personality can take. Your actions will have an impact on him, but you won't know in what way. While making choices that determine the course of events there\u2019s little way to tell how the experiences will shape him in the long run. You'll just have to see what he becomes once time moves forward.\nYou will get to decide directly how Cove and you feel about each other. Using a combination of Comfort and Interest Levels you'll design a custom relationship. \n\nAt the start of each new stage of life you'll have the option to change your feelings on Cove. He'll respond in kind to however much interest you show towards him. \nThrough Interest Levels you can make a slow burn romance, starting at \"Disinterest\" and having the feelings grow over time steadily until Love is reached only at the very end. Or you can be totally into each other from the beginning. Or you can always stay just good friends. Or something else. The experience can be further customized by trying out different Comfort Levels and experimenting with the various ways Cove can develop.\r\n  \nThere are also two extra love interest options who will be available through paid DLC. Those guys have personalities/futures/appearances that remain consistent. They aren't changeable in the way Cove is.\n\nJamie Last (name can be changed) has spent the last couple weeks on a summertime high. At eight-years-old nothing is better than what feels like endless days of school-less adventures, especially when you live walking distance from the beach. While coming home under a scorching sunset one fine evening, Jamie is approached by a stranger. The man is looking for a kid who can do him a favor, and he\u2019s even offering to pay for it. He wants Jamie to please be friends with his only child. The person is Mr. Holden, Jamie\u2019s new neighbor as well as the father of the odd, and oddly named, boy Cove. Whether Jamie wants to play along or not, Cove isn\u2019t going anywhere. He's present in Jamie's life for far longer than they ever would've guessed. \nAnd somehow the long days of vacation finally come to an end. Summer may not be able to last forever, but Jamie can take comfort in knowing it will come back again someday\u2026\n"

    "description": "Welcome to the Autonauts Prototype! We haven't updated it since the end of 2017 and have no plans to do anything else with it, but here it remains for posterity (or a crude introduction to what the game's about).\nIf you're interested in more, click the image below to be taken to the full release on Steam!\nPUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT\nPlease don't post about the Steam version here, not when there's such a lovely space to do that\u00a0in the Autonauts Steam Community. This itch.io space is dedicated to the prototype only. Cheers!\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nThe latest stable Autonauts prototype is 21.2, with or without lighting depending on your video card :)\n\nThe Change Log for all versions to date can be viewed\u00a0HERE.\nWho or what are the Autonauts?\nThe 'Automationauts' (to give them their fuller, granderer, longerwindederer title) travel the universe with the sole goal of setting worlds in motion through the power of automation.\nThey harness whatever natural resources are available; they learn fast and can eventually make pretty much anything from anything. But their most important creations are workerbots, which can be made from the crudest of materials and taught to do anything an Autonaut can do so they can get on with helping species evolve.\n+ + + AUTOWORK IN AUTOPROGRESS + + +\nThis pre-pre-pre-Alpha release is lacking refinement and presentation - and it can take some getting into - but under the rough edges there's a great example of what we're doing and where we're going. If you like what you see, play and automate here, check out the\u00a0full version on Steam!\nHow to Play\nUse a combination of mouse and keyboard.\nWASD\u00a0or SHIFT+RMB or Middle Mouse button\u00a0to pan the camera around.Mousewheel zooms the camera in and out.LMB tells your Autonaut where to go and what to do.LMB also picks things up and makes things happen.RMB drops things.Z can be used for some things like instruments and signs.Space\u00a0blows your whistle so you can get the attention of workerbots.I brings up your inventory: what's in your hands and your backpack; you can drag and drop objects between slots - and even trade with your workerbots. Holding Left Shift and clicking an object will automatically swap between hands /inventory or player/bot., and . (< and >) cycle forwards and backwards through your inventory (to swap the item in your hands)./\u00a0or Q stows the held item (assuming there's space in your inventory) so you can use your empty hands for other tasks.H brings up the 'Hot Bar' so you can quickly swap items between your hands and your Inventory.E brings up the Edit Menu, which is where you choose what to build; note that some things can only be built on flooring.R rotates building blueprints clockwise, so you can choose which way they face.RMB deletes a blueprint; DEL\u00a0(fn-backspace on Mac)\u00a0allows you to delete buildings once built (but only while in Edit Mode).Esc pauses the game and brings up the Pause Menu, from where you can save and load progress.C\u00a0toggles 'Free Cam' on/off. Use WASD to move around, Q/E to move up and down and Left Shift to move faster; the Mouse Scroll Wheel zooms in/out; Up/Down Arrow changes movement speed.X\u00a0recentres the camera on you.\nIn this basic world you will find earth, sand, sea, fresh water, clay, rock, trees and cereal - and the resident folk, who are content to sit around in the buff, doing nothing.\nAnd speaking of nothing, that's exactly what you start with. But from these humble beginnings you can build and automate an entire civilisation. Well, you can when the game's further along; for now you can only start a forestry and cereal farming, and provide shelter and food for the folk.\nYou can also make and teach robots how to do anything you can do, which is aces.\nPlease Note\nAutonauts is so early in its development that we won't be able to guarantee the compatibility of saved games between versions (but we will do our best to minimise issues).\nAlso, the Linux version is still untested by us (because we don't have Linux) but feedback so far suggests that it's working well enough, so we'll keep supplying a Linux version with every update :)\nHandy Quickstart Guide\nSo, yeah, this guide may well be creaking around the joints but it's still valid and useful :)\nPick up a Stick, pick up a Stone and build a Crude Axe.Chop down some Trees.Go to the Edit Menu (E) and select 'Simple Flooring' blueprint; place two Simple Flooring blueprints down side by side.Build the Simple Flooring by putting Logs into it.Call up the Edit Menu again and select Crude\u00a0Bench Saw blueprint; place one on the built flooring.Build the Crude\u00a0Bench Saw by putting Logs and Planks into it (use your axe to chop Logs to make Planks).Add a 'Worker Assembler' blueprint (which doesn't need to be on the Simple Flooring).Use the Crude Bench Saw to make Planks and Poles for the Worker Assembler.Add a 'Basic Workbench' blueprint (you might need more Simple Flooring) and build it.Click the Basic Workbench and change it to output 'Crude Gear.'Stick a Plank into the Basic Workbench to get a Crude Gear out.Add the Crude Gear to the Worker Assembler along with Planks and Poles to make your first Workerbot.Press Space to whistle and select your Workerbot.\u00a0Click 'Trade' and put an Axe into its hand (you'll also need an axe for yourself).Click 'Teach' then chop a tree; click 'Repeat' and then 'Go' to get the Workerbot started.Sit back and enjoy watching your Workerbot chop trees forever (well, until its axe breaks).Now automate EVERYTHING!\nIf you still get stuck, don't forget to check out our YouTube playthrough of the first version from a million years ago, which we really really REALLY ought to update soon. And don't be shy: feel free to vent in the comments below or use the following official channels...\n\n\n\n@automationauts\n\u00a0\n\n"

After extensive\r\n\n\r\n\ttesting we found a calibration that worked for all browsers, except Chrome.\r\n\t\n\n\r\n\t(If you are hitting bang on beat it will still be within the 'perfect' margin on\r\n\n\r\n\tChrome, it will just be less forgiving to late timings and more forgiving to hitting\r\n\n\r\n\t early)\r\n\t\n\r\n\t \tIF YOU INSIST ON USING CHROME:\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Chrome problem is not specific to this game, but affects\r\n\n\r\n\tall games. It's just this game requires a degree of accuracy so high that the\r\n\n\r\n\ttiny lag caused by Chrome's inbuilt Flash Player is enough to  \r\n\t\n\r\n\tthrow the timing off. YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK IN CHROME by going to chrome://plugins and disabling all plugins with \r\n\t\n\r\n\t'PepperFlash' in the location. This will make it use the normal Flash player like the other browsers, if you have it \r\n\t\r\n\tinstalled.\r\n\n\r\n\tIF YOU ARE USING LINUX:\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you get significant delays in hearing sounds, check \r\n\tthis thread for a solution. Thanks to @EspyoPT for the tip!\r\n\n\r\n\tIF YOU STILL THINK THE TIMING IS OFF: You are\r\n\n\r\n\tprobably used to hitting earlier in all rhythm games. In this game, you must\r\n\n\r\n\tget over the automatic compensation that you usually do. One easy way\r\n\n\r\n\tto do this is to hit the spacebar with force, as if you are hitting a drum,\r\n\n\r\n\tand making sure that sound coincides exactly with the clap\r\n\n\r\n\tfrom the game. Try hitting\r\n\n\r\n\ta surface near your spacebar for the first six beats,\r\n\n\r\n\tlistening to the sound of your hits,\r\n\n\r\n\tand then SLAMMING your hand onto your spacebar on the seventh! This\r\n\n\r\n\tadvice seemed to work with almost everybody when\r\n\n\r\n\twe had a booth at GDC. Sorry about\r\n\n\r\n\tyour spacebar\n\r\n\tAnd if after all that you still think it is off, tweet me! This is really important to us!\r\n\n\n\n"

    "description": "Now on Steam, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch!\nStreets of Rogue is a rogue-lite about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like Deus Ex.\nRather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.\nIn order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.\nWill you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later?A stealthy doctor who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to silently take down the opposition?A genial bartender who can talk his way past the most intimidating of guards?Or how about a hyper-intelligent gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?\n\nThe Mighty Feature-List\nPlay the game YOUR way! Don't want to kill anybody? That's cool! Want to hack computers? Got ya covered!Random world generation and TOTALLY EXTREME gameplay variety means you can play for 600 hours and not get bored! Seriously though, go outside!!!Super-advanced artificial intelligence that won't put up with your crap! Outsmart these virtual humans and feel superior to your computer!Play as over 40 types of characters (in the final version)! Bartender, scientist, hacker, gorilla \u2014 hey, your job is probably in there too!Stupidly huge number of items (in the final version)! Shrink rays, hypnotizing devices, boomboxes, bear traps, food processors.. Oh, and guns too.4-player local and online coop modes lets you brutalize goons AND loneliness!  Online mode currently available in the Steam version.Lead a gang, free slaves, drink beer, gib ghosts, become a vampire, shrink people and stomp on them. The most insanely varied game ever made.This itch.io version acts as an extended demo.\u00a0 Same gameplay as the full version, but with less content and fewer game modes."

Now the two of you must spend an entire three-month journey alone with each other aboard the small, maintenance ship that is taking you back to civilization. Along the way, there is little on board to keep you occupied... save the android. He calls himself Silas. As the situation forces you to get to know one another, you quickly figure out that while he may not have emotions the way WE understand them, he IS a construct designed to learn, adapt, and serve... This, My Soul is a scifi-romance VN project for Nanoreno 2017. The story will be linear with heavy amounts of choice, similar to my current on-going project, Queen's Crown.It will feature:- Three possible endings: Normal end, Friendship end, and Romance end.- A protagonist whose name and personality are determined by you.- A romantic interest who will react differently, and evolve as a character differently, depending on how you treat him.- A 40,000+ word script (roughly 2 hours of gameplay?)- 6 beautiful, original CGs- Original sprites, 3D-rendered backgrounds, GUI, and music!This, My Soul will be rated T for suggestive material.

During the development of this game we have gotten our inspiration from various japanese RPG MAKER games of the same genre such as Ib and The Witch's House which have motivated us to create our own.\n\u203b The game isn't suited for people with a nervous disposition for things such as horror and graphical horror such as blood and brutal deaths. \n\u203b Please note that it relies on an exceptional amout of symbolism which may be hard to understand throughout the first playthrough, so multiple playthroughs may be advised.\n\u203b To get the best experience out of the game we recomment the player to use headphones and adjust the screen brightness accordingly.\n\ud83c\udf83 Premiss \ud83c\udf83\nThe events of Pocket Mirror take place in a mysterious world where the player has to guide the main character in her journey to find her true identity. It is filled with dramatic as well as funny moments throughout and there are several characters to get to know throughout the game! \nThe storytelling relies on symbolism and hints scattered throughout the game. It's divided into 2 main sub-plots although there are quite a few more, less relevant, sub-plots to experience.\n\ud83c\udf83 Features \ud83c\udf83\n\ud83c\udf1f Original artwork\n\ud83c\udf1f Original animation (movies)\n\ud83c\udf1f Original soundtrack\n\ud83c\udf1f Visual novel elements\n\ud83c\udf1f Extra content in-game (music room, image gallery, secret content)\n\ud83c\udf1f Hearing impaired mode\n\ud83c\udf1f Voice acting\n\ud83c\udf83 Contact \ud83c\udf83\nOfficial Blog: astralshiftpro.tumblr.com\nBug reports:\u00a0astralshiftpro@gmail.com\nMain contact: astralshiftpro@gmail.com\n\ud83c\udf83 Troubleshooting \ud83c\udf83\nPlease visit our FAQ if you have any more questions regarding the game or Astral Shift's policies. \nIf you need more information you can always refer to our Terms and Conditions, read the READ ME.txt file included in the game folder, tweet us @AstralShiftDS or send us an e-mail at astralshift@gmail.com!\n\ud83c\udf83 Changelog ver. 1.3 \ud83c\udf83\n- Replacement of various uncredited resources with original resources.- Bug fix.- Atribution of proper resource credits.\n"

    "description": "\n\"Everything is going to be OK\" is a desktop labyrinth of vignettes, poetry, strange fever dream games, and broken digital spaces. It is a collection of life experiences that are largely a commentary on struggle, survival, and coping with the aftermath of surviving bad things.On the surface it comes off as dark comedy, and humor is a prevalent theme, but as you interact the themes start to unravel and facilitate, what I hope to be, a deeper discussion about these topics.I call it an interactive zine because it's broken, painful, beautifully terrible, and profound on a very personal level. Nothing about this is fiction, although the themes are abstract enough so that anyone can approach it and find it relatable.It is a very personal \"game\", and I view it as something other than a game. Through-ought development I had been struggling with the \"game\" label, and toxicity that calling something like this \"game\" brings in, which I documented extensively here (or on my blog). There is also a good interview here about these issues... As a result, I feel like calling work like this a game might do it more harm than good.\"Everything is going to be OK\" is something to experience without game expectations. Its spaces, pages, and environments, are built to be explored.It most certainly doesn't exist for the sole purpose of entertainment, and if you are looking for something small, lighthearted and fun, this might not be it. It is a very different type of experience.\nYou can read the full Artist's Statement here.\n\"Everything is going to be OK\" has appeared in a number of festivals, and publications... such as Indiegames.com, PC Gamer, Wired, Mashable... and winning IndieCade's Interaction Award, and AMAZE's Digital Moments...

After fighting for decades against an intangible and ephemeral existential threat from beyond the solar system, Earth command has declared the war effort a huge waste of time. The honeymoon is over, and a future of glittering cities across the solar system and cosmic battles between giant robots just isn\u2019t going to happen. The outcome is clear: it\u2019s time to come home.\nBut we don\u2019t care. Giant robots may not make any sense. Celestial cities across the solar system are silly dreams. They are, however, extremely awesome. We, the girls who were raised in space, to be special and incredible and pave the way for a new future, aren\u2019t giving up so easily. We\u2019ve got invincible Ship-Selves for ferrying human bodies through time and space, and we have the weight and power to make a fantasy of the future real.We\u2019re not going out without a fight.From the Creators of We Know The DevilHeaven Will Be Mine is a queer science fiction mecha visual novel from the creators of queer cult horror visual novel We Know The Devil, about joyriding mecha, kissing your enemies, and fighting gravity\u2019s pull.

    "description": "Welcome to\u00a0Voxel Tycoon\u00a0- a strategy game about transportation, factories, and mining in infinite voxel landscapes.\n\n\nWHAT IS PRE-ALPHA?\nIn Voxel Tycoon terminology, \"Alpha\" is the upcoming Early Access version on Steam. Not all planned features for that release are completed yet, so we're calling the current version \"Pre-Alpha\". Don't get us wrong, however; the game is largely stable and playable, it just requires a few content updates.\nProviding you access to the game at the current stage gives us several development opportunities, like large-scale public testing, gathering community feedback, and improving gameplay further, before moving onto our full Early Access release.\nBy participating, you not only help to make the game better, but also:\nReceive a Steam key\u00a0\u00a0after the game reaches Early AccessChance to be featured in the credits by actively participating in testing\n\nPRE-ALPHA FEATURES\n\nThe game has more than 50 vehicles representing eras from steam to electric, among which are locomotives, railcars, trucks (including semi-trailers!) and more.\nEvery vehicle has its own unique properties that you should take into account when buying and building consists with them. Thanks to our physics simulation, vehicles will behave differently based on their weight, the type and amount of cargo they're carrying, motive power and grades.\nFlexible scheduling allows, among other things, to select exact tracks where trains should arrive at stations, or choose what specific railcars should load or unload at any given stop. You can give mass orders using Routes, or setup individual tasks for each vehicle on your roster.\nBridging and tunneling, along with a full signaling system (you don't want your trains to crash into each other, do you?), allow you complete freedom to build and expand your network.\n\nOrganize mining with mine shafts, then process the raw materials using crushers, furnaces, refineries and other machinery.\nComplex production chains require complex logistics! Design unique factories of your very own by connecting machinery, buildings and storage facilities with conveyor belts.\nFund and supply research of new technologies, unlocking new buildings, production chains, and vehicles.\n\nEvery city has its own needs, which you can fulfill to kick-start growth. The bigger a city gets, the more consumers move in, meaning more potential profit! Growth of a city doesn't simply increase the quantity of goods required - higher stages of development will move away from the basics, requiring more complex and expensive products.\nKeep in mind that the values of goods are not constant and depend heavily on your actions as the supplier. Higher demand leads to higher prices! As a last resort, you can always help cities and business solve their financial problems directly by investing funds in their development.\n\nExplore an unlimited, procedurally-generated world filled with unique biomes, from deserts to arctic tundra. Unlock new regions to find rare resources and new development opportunities. The world is endless, so you\u2019ll never run out of space.\nFor the most successful tycoons, we include full-featured terraforming: turn the world into exactly what you want, all according to your perfect plan! Keep in mind, however, it might cost you a fortune.\nThe world is not limited to the classic top-down Tycoon view - Free Camera mode allows you to immerse yourself directly into the action. Fly around in first person for gorgeous views, get a closer detailed look at production chains, and even ride around on your trains while they do their job.\n\nAlmost all the basic content of the game can be customized and changed to suit your needs. In addition, you can add new vehicles, buildings, resources, production technologies, research, and any other supported content. The game is bundled with the always up-to-date modding tools.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\nOur plans for the next few months include:\nPassenger transportationElectric grids and power plantsLiquid cargoes and tanksExtending existing features with new contentFurther performance optimizationsImproving game balanceExtending modding capabilities, including C# API\nOf course, our players (you) are the primary source of feedback, so we'll prioritize things based on anything we hear from you.\nAlso, if you'd like to help us translate the game to your native language, now is a great time to pitch in!\nWe try to deliver new updates several times a week. You can always check all the update history in our public changelog.\n\nKeep in mind that, while Pre-Alpha is a fully playable version, the game is not yet complete. If:\n\nYou want to play with content that is not in the game yet, like pipelines and liquid cargo, electricity, or passengersYou want to play multiplayerYou are not ready for your saves to occasionally be wiped with updatesYou're not ready to play without tutorials\nYou don't understand the concept of testing of an unfinished product\nwe recommend waiting for Early Access on Steam to get the full Voxel Tycoon experience.\n\nFor press:\nThere are no restrictions on showing or streaming Pre-Alpha, but keep in mind that many things will be changed during this phase. Get in touch if you have any questions or ideas!\n\nMinimum system requirements:\n\n64-bit processor and operating systemOS:\u00a0Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+Processor:\u00a0Dual Core 2GHzMemory:\u00a04 GB RAMGraphics:\u00a0512MB VRAMDirectX:\u00a0Version 11Storage:\u00a01 GB available space\n\nMusic by\nAudioInsurgency.comAudioInsurgency@gmail.com\n\nTHANK YOU!

    "description": "\t\tThe Blind Griffin is an otome game developed by Asphodel Quartet for NaNoRenO 2015. Our team is made up of artists Auro-Cyanide and Rins, writer/programmer Lorelei, and composer/musician Noyemi K. The game features three different character routes (Giovanni, Alexei, and Emilio) and has 10 different endings. The game is free with a pay-what-you-want system in place for people who'd like to leave a tip.Trigger/content warnings for mentions and/or depictions of: death, execution, suicide, drug use/abuse, alcohol. We recommend that players be at least 13 years of age to play this game.PURCHASE THE ORIGINALSOUNDTRACK HERE!S T O R Y\tIt's the roaring 20's. Alcohol-loving Americans are chafing underneath the restrictions of Prohibition, but speakeasies have thankfully risen to fill the void with ill-begotten booze. The Blind Griffin is one such speakeasy in San Francisco, California, but it's about to go out of business...because its employees are a den of magicians who are more concerned with their magical studies and experiments than moonshine! Desperate not to lose the building that has become their haven, they hire the first streetsmart guttersnipe they find with some experience to help turn things around, but could she perhaps turn out to be the strongest magician of them all?\tC H A R A C T E R S      \n GIOVANNI (GIO) // The speakeasy's premier violinist. He moonlights as a saxophone player but he's awful at it (nobody tells him). The laid-back older brother of the group and widely regarded to be the strongest magician of the coven, Gio takes the safety of the group as a whole very seriously. Specializes in earth magic. MARIE // The owner of the Blind Griffin. She was disowned by her high-class family because of her gender identity, but is allowed to keep the building provided the business turns a profit. Cultured and delicate, Marie is unfortunately a busybody for whom money seems like it's water. Do NOT make comments about her height. ALEXEI // The displaced nobleman. He and his family were part of the Russian imperial court, but had to emigrate to America after the revolution. Though he acts cold towards people he's unfamiliar with and comes off as blunt and awkward at first, he is actually kind at heart and easily flustered. Specializes in water/ice magic. EMILIO // The working class baby of the group. Emilio is the most junior member of the coven until the heroine arrives. His family runs a small bistro, but they barely make ends meet. His bad experiences with non-mages have put a chip on his shoulder and added fuel to his already hot-tempered, megalomaniacal tendencies. Specializes in fire magic. ??? // The heroine. The youngest child of a large Chinese family, she had to make herself useful from a young age and thus never received any formal education. She is practical, street-smart, and no nonsense. For some reason, she hates her actual name so she goes by a nickname (that the player sets). The extent of her powers is unknown. VIVIENNE (VIVI) // The songstress. A city slicker originally from New York, she saw Bessie Smith performing live once and was so totally star-struck that she decided right then and there that she would put her all into becoming a singer. Vivi is bubbly and sweet-natured, but also quite headstrong. Specializes in air magic."

    "description": "The ultimate starship designer,powered by a deep game simulation...\nCosmoteer is a starship design, simulation, and battle game. Design a fleet of ships by laying out individual rooms and corridors, including cannons, lasers, shields, and thrusters. Battle other starships to earn bounties and use that money to expand your own ship. A dynamic crew and combat simulation makes every design decision important and interesting.\nBest-In-Class Starship Designer\n\nDesign the greatest starship ever made using an interface that is easy-to-learn yet incredibly flexible.\nBuild your ship by placing individual modules onto a grid\u2014weapons, shields, engines, reactors, crew's quarters, and more! Few restrictions and no pre-defined, creativity-limiting hull shapes mean you can create almost any ship you can imagine.\nThe exterior of a ship is like an artist's canvas, but it requires no drawing ability to make your ship look great! Simply pick a color and texture to customize your ship's basic appearance, then optionally add decals such as shapes, symbols, and letters to give it extra visual flourish. Painting your ship is free and has no effect on gameplay.\nIntelligent Crew Simulation\n\nEvery starship is operated by a crew numbering from half-a-dozen to hundreds\u2014sometimes more than a thousand\u2014of individually-simulated people.\nA ship's crew is its lifeblood. Crew not only operate its controls, but they also carry supplies such as ammunition and power batteries to weapons and systems. When a weapon wants to shoot, the crew go pick up ammo or batteries at an ammo factory or reactor and bring them to the weapon\u2014all simulated in real-time.\nCrew are pretty smart and act mostly on their own, which is a good thing since there can be so many. Your crew are smart enough to figure out what controls need operating, what systems need ammo or power, and how best to get around your ship. They're even smart enough to avoid routes that are already jammed with other people.\nThe crew simulation is what makes starship design so interesting, because how fast a cannon can shoot or how long a shield can stay charged depends directly on how quickly crew can deliver ammo or power to it. As a player, you'll have to think carefully about how you design your ship's layout so that it operates at peak efficiency without exposing its more vulnerable (and sometimes explosive!) modules.\nPhysics-Driven Flight & Combat\n\nEvery ship is part of a 2D physics simulation, and the position and orientation of its thrusters realistically affects its movement. Small ships with lots of thrusters are fast and nimble, while large ships with proportionally fewer thrusters are naturally slower and more difficult to maneuver.\nWeapons obey the laws of the physics simulation. Whether or not a cannon or laser hits an enemy depends not on a dice roll but upon the trajectory of the shot and the size and speed of the enemy.\nDamage is tracked module-by-module, and each module can be individually targeted & destroyed. Some modules can explode, causing collateral damage to the surrounding modules, so you'll have to think carefully about where you place your reactors and munitions. Too close to the edge and they'll be exposed to enemy fire; too far and your weapons won't fire fast enough.\nShips can break apart into multiple pieces when their connecting modules are destroyed. Usually this will be a crippling blow, but any piece that has a control room, power, and thrusters can continue to operate independently, potentially remaining a threat to the enemy.\nSingle-Player\n\nYou are a bounty hunter, traveling from sector to sector, hunting down renegade enemies and destroying them.\nEarn money for every enemy vanquished. Use your income to repair and upgrade your own fleet, growing bigger and more powerful with every victory.\nExplore a galaxy in search of bigger and more powerful enemies. The galaxy will crumble before your almighty armada!\nOr play in a creative sandbox mode with unlimited credits if being a bounty hunter isn't your cup of Earl Grey\u2014the only limit is your imagination! (And the power of your computer.)\nMultiplayer\n\nBattle your friends and enemies in real-time, pitting your designs against theirs. Compete to be the master \"Starship Architect & Commander\" against up to 7 other players in Team vs Team and Free For All battles.\nConfigure a variety of game options by specifying number of ships, total funds, game speed, and other options. Play tiny skirmishes, massive fleet battles, or anywhere in between.\nPlay online in public or private lobbies. Local Area Network and direct I.P. address connections are also supported.\nImportant Note: Multiplayer is NOT SUPPORTED between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems!\nAnd more!\n\nEverything you should expect from a PC game, including customizable controls, windowed and borderless display modes, support for high-resolution displays, no mandatory locked framerates, and dozens of other options to tailor the game to your own preferences.\nIt's easy to share your ship designs with friends and other players. Ships are saved as simple PNG image files and can be easily shared on social media like Twitter, Discord, and the official forums\u2014just drag-and-drop the image from your browser right into Cosmoteer and the ship will be instantly playable!\nA powerful modding framework lets mods change almost any part of the game data, opening up a universe of possibilities beyond the base game. A mods manager makes it easy to install and uninstall mods created by the Cosmoteer community. \nUnobtrusive tutorials that don't interrupt gameplay and are easy to dismiss or turn off altogether. There's no special \"tutorial level\" you need to play through\u2014the context-sensitive tips are built-in to the main Bounty Hunter mode.\nMain Website\nForum\nChat (Discord)\nWiki"

A CRT you don't remember owning flashes to life. Frozen in place you look upon the flickering screen to spy a dismal, bloodied scene. A cracked and faded jewel case sits close beside.

There's also been some confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on any sort of hardware from the time.

We plan for there to be a\u00a0minimum\u00a0of 5 volumes, each totaling approximately 2.5-3 hours of playtime over the three routes.\nYour purchase will give you access to the download of the Prologue and all subsequent volume/chapter updates, including upcoming side quests and mini games for no additional cost (ever!).\n\n\n\u00a0\"Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men; the good, and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue.\"\n- David Hume\nErrant Kingdom\u00a0is a queer, high-fantasy visual novel for PC, Mac & Linux, and is the second game by Lunaris Games, the indie team behind supernatural murder mystery & #2 on itch.io's top rated games (2019),\u00a0\u00a0When The Night Comes.\nThe Kingdom of Novus has been thrown into disarray, and it's up to you to decide if you\u2019ll help to bring peace, or if you\u2019ll stoke the fires of chaos. Enter a high fantasy world steeped in political intrigue; where magic touches the land and blood turns the wheels unseen. Dishonor & betrayal. Hope & despair. Pick a side, and meet your match.\nErrant Kingdom is a story with darker elements at play. As a denizen of the kingdom of Novus, you're at the heart of watching history unfold before your eyes. Whether you see its rise or fall, however, is up to you.\u00a0There are those who will help you in your endeavors along the way, and might even find themselves enamored with you. Though, it is also possible to earn their ire should your plans be devious. Only\u00a0you\u00a0will influence how the story evolves, and the most important moves to make are yours, and yours alone.\nErrant Kingdom features three playable protagonists (with no fixed protagonist portrait, leaving players free to imagine their character as they see fit) and eight potential romance routes (six individual, two polyamorous). You can also play the game without romancing anyone and it will not affect your experience in any way.\u00a0\nWe have no in-game purchases, and this one-off cost will give you access to a potential 240+ hours of game play when taking into account our 8 romance routes, our no romance play-through, and our three different MC roles. Each play-through has the potential to be vastly different, depending on your choices, your actions, and the way you interact with those around you.\u00a0\nYou can play our mini demo now which will show you a small portion of the Nomad route!\u00a0\nErrant Kingdom will be Rated 18+ for explicit language, violence, and sexual themes. The game is made with the Unity engine.\n\n\nYou're a revered noble from Vih'thris chosen by your King to serve as an Ambassador to the kingdom of Novus. Previous meetings between you have made you see eye to eye, and you've managed to establish a friendly, but tenuous alliance. While newly immersed in the court of Novus, you advocate for the betterment of both kingdoms. However, though you may serve the realm, you also serve the people. The assassination attempt puts into question both the King & Queen's ability to rule, and their integrity. It's up to you to decide how you will proceed.\u00a0\n\nYou've been sent to Novus from the neighboring kingdom of Vih'thris as a show of good faith between rulers. Hand-picked by your king, your reputation as a knight proceeds you, and you've been charged to serve Novus and its inhabitants in the name of glory. The reception to your arrival has been promising, but following an attempt on the lives of Novus' rulers, everything has been thrown into chaos. You've sworn to protect Novus with your life, but are you happy to serve the sometimes bloody hands that rule?\n\nBy the order of a high-ranking associate in your hometown, you find yourself stationed in Novus; a kingdom that has a grudge against its newly appointed rulers. As a small rebellion threatens to find its footing, you plant yourself amongst the 'normal folk' to cause chaos. Though, it is up to you to decide if you will stoke those fires of rebellion, or if you'll douse them and reduce them to ash.\u00a0\n\n\nWe want to give those who might not be interested in pursuing a romance the chance to comfortably enjoy the game. You can play the game without having to select any flirt options, or enter a relationship, whilst still experiencing the story in-full.\n\nDepending on your choices and actions throughout the game on our dialogue wheel\u00a0your reputation will fluctuate. This system will allow players to unlock special dialogue options and experiences that will influence the reactions of those around you, all tailored around the choices you make, just like in your favorite RPGs!\n\nIn Novus' town square from Volume One (coming February 2020)\u00a0you'll find a mission board where you can pick up additional mini-quests for added game play. With each update, the board will change, and you'll get the chance to embark on some weird and wonderful journeys in addition to the main story-line. Though, you'll have to wade through the letters of complaint, petty disputes between townsfolk, and lonely hearts adverts first...\n\nUnlock character information, lore, and much more in our Codex that will appear in the main menu alongside our CG gallery!\n\nErrant Kingdom has a LGBTQA+ cast of love interests, each with their own unique backgrounds and intertwining stories. You will begin the game as merely an acquaintance, but as the story progresses you will have the chance to spend time with each of them. Eventually, if you choose a romance route, you will become exclusive with one (or two, if polyamorous options are selected) of our love interests, and will gain access to special scenes, CGs, and conversations. \u00a0\nAll six love interests are romanceable individually, and our polyamorous relationships are Lucien & Raiden, and Maja & Erik. Roux is asexual, and Livia is demisexual.\nOur story is linear, so once a romance is selected, you will still interact with all of our other cast members! We're trying to bring an RPG style of game play to the Visual Novel world, and this is one of the elements we're most passionate about executing well.\u00a0\nYou can also check out our character playlists over on\u00a0Spotify!\u00a0\n\n\nL-R top row; Lucien (they/them), Raiden (he/him), Livia (she/her)\nL-R bottom rowl\u00a0Erik (he/him) , Maja (she/her) , Roux (they/them)\nWe're a queer indie development team with a passion for creating immersive, narrative-driven stories filled with diverse characters.\u00a0\nWe believe that representation matters, whether it be solving supernatural murders, or saving a kingdom.\u00a0Our primary goal is to bring the stories & games to the LGBTQA+ community that it so sorely needs, and to do that with the love it deserves and that we have for it.\u00a0\n\nWebsite/\u00a0Shop| Twitter| Instagram\n"

    "description": "\u00a0\nPLAY THE FAITH: CHAPTER III DEMO HERE!\n\nFAITH: Chapter II\u00a0is a pixel horror game inspired by the era of MS-DOS, Apple II, Atari, and ZX Spectrum classics.\nCheck out the original FAITH!\nTRY BEFORE YOU BUY:\u00a0The FAITH: Chapter II Demo is a stand-alone, spoiler-free demo that is a separate experience from the full game. It is meant as a \"vertical slice\" to show off new features/mechanics etc. and allow you to detect any technical issues. IT IS A SEPARATE EXPERIENCE FROM THE FULL GAME.\u00a0If you would like to donate, please do! It's basically it's own game in itself :) Scroll to the bottom of this page to find the demo!\n\n\nOn September 21, 1986, two priests arrived at the Martin Family home in rural Connecticut to investigate an apparent case of demonic possession. Only two people would leave the house alive.\nAfter confronting unspeakable dark entities and narrowly escaping with his life, a\u00a0young priest descends into a new nightmare.\n\n\nFAITH: Chapter II takes place during the \"Satanic Scare\" of the 1980s, a period of widespread paranoia of devil-worshiping, witchcraft, and occult practices. There was no Internet, no text messaging, and no GPS. Forget blue-and-pink neon. The 1980s were scary.\n\nControls:\nMovement: WASD / arrow keysAction: SpacePause / Review notes: Esc\nIt is recommended that you play with an Xbox controller.\n\nIMPORTANT GRAPHICS NOTE:\u00a0FAITH\u00a0is known to have game-breaking graphics issues for users with onboard Intel HD graphics cards like the Intel HD Graphics 4000. I highly recommend downloading and playing the demo to see if you get any graphical issues.\nTo report bugs or compatibility issues, please send an email to: Airdorf(at)gmail(dot)com.

    "description": "At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the \"interludes,\" which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).\n\nSee also:\nLimits & Demonstrations\nThe Entertainment\nHere And There Along The Echo\nUn Pueblo De Nada\n\nVisit us at: kentuckyroutezero.com or cardboardcomputer.com"

    "description": "ANNOUNCEMENT: I have taken the game down. I'm leaving the page up, but the downloads have been removed. Check the latest devlog for more info on this.What is Unreal PT\nUnreal PT is a short psychological horror game, completely recreating the athmosphere and gameplay of the PT originally published on the Playstation 4.\u00a0\nAbout the Making of Unreal PT\nUnreal PT was under constant development over the course of 9 months, starting in April 2018 and ending in January 2019. Textures, models, animations, gameplay, and code\u00a0have been recreated\u00a0from scratch (more details on this in the development logs).\u00a0\nSpecs/Technical\nPerformance:\u00a0The game has been optimized; however, there are graphics options to help further increase performance if you have a less powerful GPU.\nMinimum Tested Specs: CPU: i3-7100U 7th Generation with Intel HD 620GPU: IntegratedRAM: 8GB DDR4HQ SSR Turned off and resolution at 35% gets ~30fps with these specs\nGameplay Notes\r\n\nSupported controls:\u00a0Mouse\u00a0+\u00a0Keyboard, Playstation\u00a0and\u00a0Xbox\u00a0controllers, VR\u00a0motion\u00a0controllers. \nAdditional Notes: The gameplay is nearly identical to the original. The biggest difference is the very end of the game has been changed slightly to make beating it more consistent. The controls are explained as the game progresses, but if you get stuck at any point I've included two text files in the main directory, one with the controls, the other with a guide on how to beat the game.\nVR\n I've been looking through forums, and it looks like VR is completely busted and has multiple issues. You are welcome to try it, but I don't recommend it.NOTE:\u00a0I have fixed a lot of the bugs people have pointed out to me. Info about this is in the new devlog.\n\nI hope you guys enjoy playing this as much as I loved making it!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RadiusGordello"

Although, some routes are more connected than others. Like Zeikun and Sachiro. If you are going to play all routes anyway, I suggest to start off with Zeikun or Sachiro as an introduction to the story. Kurato and Junoru routes are more plot heavy so I\u2019d do them as last. If you enjoy keeping hooked on mysteries I suggest this order: Sachiro> Zeikun> Kurato > Junoru. To understand hints given in other routes I suggest this order: Kurato > Zeikun > Sachiro or Junoru.\u00a0 After reaching any normal/romantic ending of other characters, it unlocks an extra scene at the ending of Kurato.\n\nMain Cast\n\n\u2666 Heroine (re-nameable) \u2014\u00a0A bored girl who seeks mysteries.\u2666 Zeikun \u2014\u00a0 A rude and straightforward man.\u2666 Junoru\u2014 Quiet and mysterious gentle man.\u2666 Sachiro \u2014\u00a0 A lost boy who asks for your help.\u2666 Kurato \u2014 Despite his cheerful personality, the heroine questions his intentions.\n\nLinks\nOfficial Site \u2014 Development blog and info about the game.Tumblr \u2014 Mostly doodles and short notices.Twitter\u00a0\u2014 Doodles, notices and fan creations.Discord chat Server\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Chat with fellow players and staff.\nFull walk-through by Emi\nFull walk-through 2 by Alice\n\nYou can report bugs and script errors here:\u00a0\nhttps://forms.gle/gt5Lt8JvfbA12yH8A\nIf you enjoy the content, please support us!

    "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHana, the protagonist of Asagao Academy, \r\ntransfers to the school after a series of negative experiences. She desperately wants to join the Normal Boots Club, though her motives may be less than pure. Shy, awkward, quiet, and a wee bit insecure, she has a big heart and genuinely cares about people.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMai is Hana's loud, boisterous, and spunky roommate. She's obsessed with the Normal Boots Club, Jared in particular, and is a bit blunt. Her excessive energy makes her an ace on the school's volleyball team.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJon is one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club and the head of the Drama Club. He adores bizarre retro games, and loves his pet bird, Jacques, more than life itself. Jon is charismatic, energetic, and animated. Everything seems to be going well for him - that is, until he loses something dear...\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBG, one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club, is an easy-going, caring, and optimistic guy. He doesn't bother with school, instead focusing on important things like soccer and pinball. Despite his friendliness, he's giving Hana strange looks, and then starts skipping class...\r\n\n\n\n\n\nJared is a part-time model. Naturally, he is the most attractive person in school and knows it, often coming off as vain, fickle, and shallow. Despite this, Jared truly cares for his friends, and the confidence he projects may not be as solid as it appears.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatch is an assistant librarian at the school library working on a virtual reality machine. Satch is intellectual, empathetic, mature and well-read. He always thinks of others' feelings before his own, but keeps his problems to himself - which might backfire when Normal Boots is targeted...\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShane is a foreign exchange student from England. Quiet, straightforward, and blunt, he's a natural with trivia competitions, but instead chooses to challenge himself with Nario Cart. Despite how much the club needs Hana's skills, he is steadfastly against her joining.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJirard is an avid collector of Itty Bitty Kitty figurines. Passionate, ambitious, and a bit of a perfectionist, he is the resident speed-runner. Perhaps as a result of his need to complete, he does well both academically and socially, being one of the most caring people on campus.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul, Nick, and Josh are blood bound under Continue?'s banner. They are inseparable and typically found wreaking general havoc by reenacting the '80s and '90s arcade beat-em-ups they love so dearly. Paul is running for student council president, but when a strong rival appears, will the pressure of competition be too much?\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\tFor a complete list of everyone who worked on the project, please visit \r\n\tAsagao Academy's credits page.\r\n\n\r\n\tThere is a \r\n\ttip system in place in case you'd like to support us in making future games. \r\n\tThank you so much if you do!\r\n\t\n\n\r\n\tIf you have any troubles, check out our \r\n\tTechnical Support page!\r\n\n\r\n\tThanks for playing.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04.27.2016 - Asagao Academy version 0.5 is out!

In addition to containing a completely different script from the original demo, this prologue also features new sprites and artwork for all characters, introduces one or two faces you might not have seen before, and gives you a clearer idea of what to expect when you first open the full game!Please note that this opening section will have some differences in the final product: namely, on a first playthrough, it is normally impossible to match with The Host, and some lines of dialogue have been changed to make this section stand alone more clearly. Our save/load screen also isn't implemented yet, and fonts aren't final. It's still a work in progress, but we hope you'll find something to love anyway."

On one day just like any other, a new transfer student arrives to Yukari's school. It's Koshi Tanaka! But wasn't he dead? Apparently not. The goal of the game is to figure out the mysterious circumstances of Tanaka's revival and most importantly, staying alive. Trigger Warnings: Blood and Gore (an example of one depicted above), Violence (a majority of it is implied, but include, forced amputation, implied torture, throat slashing, and stabbing) mentions of stalking, eye strain (like the first game it is fairly bright), sudden noises and the screen shakes occasionallyI worked on this with a strict deadline of a week as opposed to five days this time, and I'm proud to say it's much longer. The true route should take you around 20-30 minutes to complete! Unfortunately, the story is pretty predictable (and cheesy too haha) and quite linear, there are probably a bunch of things left unexplained and a lot of stuff I wanted to include (that didn't make the final cut) I have learned my lesson I will probably write out the script instead of making stuff up as I go next time haha. I hope you guys have as much fun playing it as I had fun making it! "

Our goal is to help Mai-Chan serve her sweet buns to\u00a0customers at her bakery.\n\nThe 4 cards at the bottom of the screen represent the orders of Mai-Chan's customers. Each customer wants a specifc number of a single type of pastry.\u00a0Our task is to find and select a line of pastries on the board that matches one of the cards.\u00a0We can select vertical or horizontal lines. But it needs to be an uniterrupted line of the same pastry\n\nWe can only serve lines of\u00a0pastries that perfectly match one of the cards. Some orders are easy to satisfy - like the x1 oders. Others may require some setup - like the x3 orders.\nIf we ever get stuck, we can look into the magical Star Box to activate special powers. Special powers cost stars. We can gain more stars by aligning 4 of the same pastry in a row.\n\nWe lose the game if we get stuck and run out of stars. But if we manage to serve all of the order cards in the deck, we win!\n\n\nMaking Of\nThis game was created as part of the A Game By Its Cover Jam 2018. The goal was to create a game based on of the cartridge covers from the Famicase Exhibition 2018. The\u00a0cover to Mai-Chan's Sweet Buns was created by\u00a0Louis Lloyd-Judson, the artist of the webcomic Apricot Cookies.\n\nThe game was written and designed by Krystian Majewski, an Independent\u00a0Developer and\u00a0the host of the\u00a0Lazy Devs Academy video channel. The entire development process was livestreamed.\n\nThe music was composed by Sebastian\u00a0Ha\u00dfler, a music composer for film, TV and videogames.

    "description": "\nGenre: Otome Fantasy, Adventure, Romance, Comedy, MysteryWARNINGS: Swearing, Blood, Death, Psychological, Flashing Lights,\u00a0& Extreme Gore. Viewer discretion is advised!Rating: 16+\n\n\nIn 20XX, an enormous earthquake shook the world and caused a triangular crater to suddenly appear in the middle of\u00a0Bermuda Triangle. The world was aghast with this discovery and it became even more concerning when scout teams came across a mysterious force, preventing people from getting too close. Those who went to examine it said that the force was like an invisible wall and there was no way around it, therefore, making further investigation difficult.\u00a0\nSpiritual events and sightings have also dramatically increased since then.It got to the point where people began to hold\u00a0festivals to honor the dead and the mythical creatures. It wasn't long until it became a new worldwide sensation and there was not a single day where spiritual events weren't on the news\nOur heroine, Maya (19), was busy earning her living\u00a0so this kind of event was of little importance aside from adding an exciting spice into her life. But then her world crumbled when a Goddess came and announced that her family would die in a car accident in the near future.\nThe Goddess offered Maya a deal: She would alter her family\u2019s fate in exchange for closing\u00a0the Bermuda Crater. In order to do so, Maya would have to go to a place called The Forgotten Isles,\u00a0find what caused it, and look for a solution.\nIf she agreed, three men would accompany her, acting as bodyguards. Apparently, they each have their own circumstances and a wish to be granted.\nGame Info:\nHi guys! My new project is finally here!  Now before you ask; \"Nusantara: Bermuda Triangle\" is not a sequel of \"Nusantara: Legend of The Winged Ones\".This is an entirely new story but set on the same universe. It covers a wider horizon of Nusantara's archipelago. Bermuda's story will be much longer, packed with content, and has lots more visual assets than Winged Ones... I dunno whether to be happy or cry about that :')) Because of this, I decided to make this project a commercial one. Features:- 4 Love interests (The last bachelor will be unlocked once you finished with all 3 main bachelors routes)- 9 Endings - 1 Constant Minigame- Casual Status Raising- Regular & Time-Limited Choices- Translation/Definition Notes (Click on the Orange Text!)- Mini Encyclopedia- CG Gallery- lots of CGs & BGs (I haven't calculate the exact number yet)- Depending on IndieGoGo's success, the bachelors & MC may have partial voice acting.My Honored Proofreaders:- KrystalFlare- crystalscm- Blas\u00e9&Voracious;I found awesome proofreaders!

    "description": "\nCaves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through a layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?\r\n\nWho are you?\n\r\n\tPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a pure-strain descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes\u2014the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the Holy City; the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul; or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\r\n\n\r\n\tYou arrive at the oasis-hamlet of Joppa, along the far rim of Moghra'yi, the Great Salt Desert. All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk. On the horizon, Qud's jungles strangle chrome steeples and rusted archways to the earth. Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky.\r\n\n\r\n\tYou clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat. You approach a watervine farmer\u2014he lifts the brim of his straw hat and says, \"Live and drink, friend.\"\r\n\nWhat can you do?\n\r\n\tAnything and everything. \r\n\tCaves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.\r\n\n\nAssemble your character from over 70 mutations and defects, 24 castes and kits, and dozens of cybernetic implants\u2014outfit yourself with wings, two heads, quills, four arms, flaming hands, or the power to clone yourself\u2014it's all the character diversity you could want.\nExplore procedurally-generated regions with some familiar locations\u2014each world is nearly 1 million maps large.\nDig through everything\u2014don't like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.\nHack the limbs off monsters\u2014every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.\nPursue allegiances with over 60 factions\u2014apes, crabs, robots, and highly entropic beings\u2014just to name a few.\nFollow the plot to Barathrum the Old, a sentient cave bear who leads a sect of tinkers intent on restoring technological splendor to Qud.\nLearn the lore\u2014there's a story in every nook, from legendary items with storied pasts to in-game history books written by plant historians. A novel's worth of handwritten lore is knit into a procedurally-generated history that's different every game.\nDie\u2014Caves of Qud is brutally difficult and deaths are permanent. Don't worry, though\u2014you can always roll a new character.\nWords about Caves of Qud\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of magnificent history to dredge from its depths.\u201d -Chris Priestman, Kill\u00a0Screen\n\u201cCaves of Qud\u00a0is one of the best roguelikes in years, packed with evocative prose and featuring a captivating world of arcane secrets to explore.\u201d -Heather Alexandra, Kotaku\n\u201cNarratively, this is one of the most compelling game stories that I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u201d -Charlie Hall, Polygon\n\u201cCaves of Qud\u00a0has a particular kind of New Wave science fiction imagination that just can\u2019t be beat.\u201d -Cameron Kunzelman, Paste MagazineSoundtrackThe soundtrack can be purchased here:\u00a0https://freeholdgames.itch.io/caves-of-qud-soundtrack"

You learned the ways of the wolf in your birth pack. Now it's time for you to learn how to live on your own, finding food, meeting other wolves, and searching for a mate. Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and build your own family.\r\n\nEmbark on a quest for survival\n\nYour quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain and eventually takes you across the Lamar Valley to Slough Creek. There, you and your mate will establish a territory and raise a litter of pups: training them, feeding them, defending them against predators, and finally taking them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Ultimately, your success will depend on your ability to ensure the survival of your pack. \nExperience Yellowstone National Park\nExplore WolfQuest's realistic recreation of the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park \u2014 \"the Serengeti of North America\" \u2014 where herds of elk and other ungulates roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high ridges.\nBut watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with other dangers as well \u2014 grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes \u2014 who all vie with you for territory and food.\nRealistic Ecology and Gameplay (Anniversary Edition)\nWolfQuest: Anniversary Edition raises the bar for realistic and accurate eco-simulation gameplay:Herds of elk roam the land in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, and other prey. Other wolf packs maintain and defend their territory against intruders -- like you.Grizzlies, cougars, coyotes, and other predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs.Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations.Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions allow you to choose a suitable mate. Vast wilderness maps (nearly 50 square kilometers) depict Yellowstone's Northern Range. Dynamic day/night, weather, and seasons immerse you in the wilderness.\nOur science advisors include some of the top wolf biologists in the world today, who help us keep WolfQuest accurate to real wolf biology and behavior.\nPlay the game alone or with friends \n\r\nIn single-player games, learn how to hunt elk, communicate with other wolves, find a mate in Amethyst Mountain.\u00a0 (Amethyst Mountain is currently available in WolfQuest 3: Anniversary Edition early access and WolfQuest 2.7)\nIn Slough Creek, establish a den and territory, raise pups, and embark on a perilous journey to a summering site.\r\n\t(Slough Creek is currently only available in WolfQuest 2.7)\n\r\nIn multiplayer games (currently only available in WolfQuest 2.7) , explore the wilderness, hunt elk, and raise pups with your friends!

    "description": "\u2745 Heart of the Woods \u2745\n\nHeart of the Woods\u00a0is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends life and death.Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they\u2019d ever seen before.However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she\u2019s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can\u2019t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she\u2019s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail\u2019s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.\n\nA part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend.She\u2019s professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt.\n\nFor the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse.\u00a0Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to.\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. She\u2019s brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether it\u2019s from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos.\n\nA loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeld\u2019s mayor, Morgan is...different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, she\u2019s known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village.However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that there\u2019s something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and she\u2019s not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots.\n-Incredible character and CG art from Rosuuri-Fully original backgrounds and soundtrack-Approximately 130,000 words with multiple endings-Ending theme from In Love With A Ghost-Multiple accessibility options-Extra features including a music room, CG viewer, and guest art gallery-At least one really, really gay ghost\nOptional 18+ Patch\nThe 18+ patch file adds two additional scenes of explicit sexual content to the game. It is not intended to be viewed or utilized by anyone under the age of 18+. To install, first download and extract the main game. Then, place the adult patch file, called adult.rpa, in the folder labeled \"game\" within the extracted contents. You can still enjoy the full story without the patch.\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack is split into two parts, with the tracks composed by Esselfortium and the tracks composed by Astartus separated. Both versions contain the tracks in .wav and .mp3 format. Ninety percent of profit goes back to the composers!\nPlease note that the ending theme by In Love With A Ghost ft.

We've hand selected the scenes in order to give a taste of the game without spoiling too many of the major plot points (we figured it's a given that Maddie and Abby end up together). To help fill in some of the blanks though, there are demo-exclusive chibi versions of Maddie and Tara who will help fill you in on what's happening along the way.\n* Chinese translation of the full game is coming later this year!"

I\u2019m really into software development and sharing my, sometimes outlandish, ideas through the games I create. The dream is to forge a game studio capable of helping others follow their own aspirations. Whether it be art, animating, modeling, coding, story writing\u2026 there\u2019s so much that goes into building games and I\u2019d love to create a home for those passionate about their craft.But that\u2019s end game. The short term goal is being able to work on Uncommon Breed and similar games full time.\nCurrent ProjectAt the moment, I\u2019m working on the RPG / Visual Novel, Uncommon Breed. In this game, your relationships affect both story and combat! Recently, I\u2019ve been lucky enough to pick up a couple of well equipped mercenaries:\nEsonver: The Great Wolf Lobster ArtistT\u0394IKAH: The Brilliant Tiger Graphics Designer\nThese two talented individuals have have helped me bring a new level of quality to the game and your support helps me pay for their art/services.At the moment, I update the game at least once a month. If I\u2019m ever able to work on it full time, you can expect 2+ updates a month.\nMore than a visual novelOne of my core motivations for making Uncommon Breed was to learn the ins and outs of Unity (a Game Development Engine) with the intent of making more interactive/complex games in the future. This is why Uncommon Breed has and will continue to evolve as I take what I learn and apply it to the game. Examples of this are:\nThe PUBA segmented dating world in which you can travel between multiple rooms and have brief conversations with the main characters. These conversations affect their affection towards you, the story, and the combat.\nCombat worldRPG style, turn based combat system with your relationships affecting combat. Did you say the right things to Grizz, the burly bear tank? His defense capabilities increased! What about Reinhard, the X Bounty Hunter? His shots are gonna start hitting really hard!\u00a0\nQuesting SystemIn the works! Quests will mainly come from the PUB.\nThe storyGet plopped into the shoes of a developing hero character and bring together a band of outlaws to save your home. Strengthen your personal relationships and find that strength translates into your battles together. Get to know and romance them but be wary of leaving the strength of your other teammates behind!\nMy Patreon page is set up with the Charge Up Front (CUF) model.This means New patrons will be charged when they first sign up.\nIf you pledge late in the month, say the 28th, you\u2019ll be charged on the day you sign up and the beginning of the next payment cycle (the 1st of every month). This makes it best to pledge at the beginning of the month to avoid being charged back to back.This is patreons way of helping alleviate content theft and helps your exclusive rewards remain exclusive!Current patrons are unaffected.\nTwitterhttps://twitter.com/UncommonBreedVNPatron download link:https://uncommonbreedvn.itch.io/uncommon-breed/patreon-accessible\n\n"

But in a town where magic is lurking just below the surface, can Eddie make it work \u2014 or will the more human side of life hold him back again?\n\nFEATURES: Five dateable guys on five different paths, ten endings, and more than seventy CGs! The full game's package also comes with two included modes for the price of one, each with their own unique experience: a PG-13 version and an R-18 one! Full dating sim release date TBA.\n\nEDDIE'S LOVE INTERESTS:\n\u00a0\u00a0\nBomb has the emotional stability of a high school boy chugging Monster Energy drinks and the humor of an old man who won't leave Twitch chat.\nCornelius is a maybe-probably-actually-magic genius with a photographic memory and enough generalized anxiety for six upset Pomeranians.\nDavis's pride and joy is his endless collection of comic, anime, and game merch, but his taste in friends and figurines are both equally questionable.\n\nLouis loves art, gardening, and dreaming about the unrealistic alternate reality where he can get more than three hours of peaceful sleep a night.\nMarco wouldn't describe himself as a dependable best friend or a person who can't let go of an unrequited crush, but he's never left Eddie's side.\u00a0\nSome Guy is just a guy. Does Eddie even know his name? Do you?\n\nCREDITS:\u00a0DarkChibiShadow\u00a0(art and design);\u00a0Nat Wesley (music and sound); Kit Pocket (quality assurance).\n\nSPECIAL THANKS: Garrett for his endless loving patience with my schedule; Bunny for their help making these characters what they are; every wonderful beta reader who took the time to help fix this demo; all my Patreon patrons for their generous support; and you, for giving it a glance!"

At the very least, it will have a lot of puns and glasses jokes.\n\nCharacters\nIris: A gentle, awkward, and surprisingly brave girl who tries her best.\nRieffe: Iris' kind but detached childhood friend who always worries about her.\n Lanneis: A strict and sarcastic person who glares and pushes up his glasses way too often.\n Wynrou: A seemingly friendly guy who prefers to be easygoing nowadays despite being an awful person in the past.\nReqieu: Used to be Iris' teacher. Serious but gentle and low-key sarcastic.\nVal: Always worries about Iris and has difficulty with being honest with feelings.\nSeptem: A serious, kind, and dutiful boy who likes flowers. He's kind of shy once you talk to him. Always polite. \nHenri: The third glasses character of the game.\n\nWarnings: blood (no gore), some themes of death and suicide\nThis game is a straightforward visual novel, so there's no walkthrough necessary. It will be very obvious when a choice will affect the ending.\nIf there are any errors with the game, email me at batensan@gmail.com and I'll get to trying to solve it right away!\n\nThis game is currently in development! I'm uncertain about the release date, but feel free to ask if you have any questions.\n\ntumblr\ntwitter\ncuriouscat (for questions)\n\nemail: batensan@gmail.com"

    "description": "Tacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year 2088. As you go about your mission, you\u2019ll explore every detail of how the station\u2019s crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.\nAt the heart of Tacoma is the facility\u2019s digital surveillance system, which has captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew\u2019s life on the station. As you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You\u2019ll use your ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing the multi-layered narrative as you explore.\nTacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling players deeper into the narrative than ever before.\nA Richly Layered Story Experience\nSix crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships, experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.\nA Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System\nIn each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine, and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes\u2019 chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.\nA Deeply Interactive Gameworld\nExplore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously exploring extensive records of the crew\u2019s digital communications and personal thoughts. Every facet of the crew\u2019s experience on Tacoma is part of your investigation.\nA Vision of the Future\nExperience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that depicts humanity\u2019s expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva\u2019s Den.\nA Compact Narrative Experience\nTacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to discover at your own pace.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nWindows:OS: Windows 7 or higher, 64-bitProcessor: 1.6ghz Intel i5-equivalent processor or higherMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Onboard or dedicated graphics accelerator with 1GB+ of video RAMDirectX: Version 11Storage: 11 GB available space\nMac:OS: OS X 10.9 or higherProcessor: 1.6ghz processor or higherMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Onboard or dedicated graphics accelerator with 1GB+ of video RAMStorage: 11 GB available space\nLinux:OS: Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 or newerProcessor: 1.6ghz Intel i5-equivalent processor or higherMemory: 4 GB RAMGraphics: Onboard or dedicated graphics accelerator with 1GB+ of video RAMStorage: 11 GB available space\n"
